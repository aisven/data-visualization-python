# Visualizing data with python

A project for studying purposes.

## Disclaimer regarding the code

The code has been written in a relatively verbose free style for studying purposes.
It is not production-ready and it is not to be regarded as research-related or blog-article code.
Inline comments have been written to verbosely describe aspects that came up during coding.
Assertions have been added to confirm certain conditions along the way.

The author is aware that production-ready code on the other hand would usually, for example,
follow principles of clean code, with automated formatting, linting, spell-checking, etc.,
contain python type-hints in a much more consistent manner,
be automatically tested via test cases written with pytest or similar libraries,
be modularized and packaged properly, with selected functions moved to 1st-party libraries,
allow for proper packaging, export, import, etc. of readily trained models,
be compatible with open source or proprietary machine learning pipelines (think MLOps, DevOps),
be integrated with respective tooling to visualize metrics about model performance,
ship together with benchmarks, examples, cook book or user guide, etc.,
be optimized to some extend.
